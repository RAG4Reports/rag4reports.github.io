### Submission Guidelines and Review Process

Papers can either be directly submitted to the RAG4Reports through OpenReview or committed through ARR. Submissions should use the ACL format with at most 8 pages excluding references. Reviewers will be asked to consider the paper’s length when writing their reviews.

Direct submissions will undergo a single-blinded peer-review process (i.e., reviewers will see the identity of the authors), and each paper will receive at least 3 reviews and one meta-review. For submissions proposing new resources, such as datasets or software, please provide access to the resource for the reviewers to assess its merit.
