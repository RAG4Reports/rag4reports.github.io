RAG4Reports are interested in various aspects of the Report Generation problem, which is a deep research task that research agents can be used to tackle it. 
The following is an incomplete list of the topics. Please reach out to us if you are unsure about whether your work is within the scope of this workshop. 

* Report generation and long-form RAG systems  
* Multilingual report generation or RAG datasets
* Agentic deep research systems
* Analysis of various components in report generation systems, such as multilingual retrieval, multilingual generative models.   
* Evaluation method for report generation

### Submission Guidelines and Review Process

Papers can either be directly submitted to the RAG4Reports through OpenReview or committed through ARR. Submissions should use the ACL format with at most 8 pages excluding references. Reviewers will be asked to consider the paper’s length when writing their reviews.

Direct submissions will undergo a single-blinded peer-review process (i.e., reviewers will see the identity of the authors), and each paper will receive at least 3 reviews and one meta-review. For submissions proposing new resources, such as datasets or software, please provide access to the resource for the reviewers to assess its merit. 

Each direct submission can choose between **archival** and **non-archival** after acceptance. If the authors decide to make the paper non-archival, we will provide a slot for presentation, but not publish the paper under our workshop.
If the authors decide to make the submission archival, we will publish the paper with the ACL Anthology.
